- Confirm year of the wiki version.
- Rearrange tables in less columns.
- Add changes done to the wiki version.
- Add quotes to example terms in English explanations.
- Fix: automatic numbering of sections with `:sectnum:` is not
  preserved in DocBook, therefore it's not rendered into EPUB, only
  into PDF. Beside, `:sectnum:` makes asciidoctor-pdf add "Chapter X"
  before the text of level-1 headings. Automatic numbering is
  deactivated.
- Add note about the change of the language name.
- Markup captions, e.g. "Pronominal adverbs".
- Decide about titles in English and Interlingue: homogenize or
  markup.
- Improve layout of examples in "Li t√©mpore e su division".
- Fix: Move examples "extracter" and "distinter" to the third step of
  the De Whal's Rule.
