- Confirm year of the wiki version.
- Rearrange tables in less columns.
- Add quotes to example terms in English explanations.
- Fix: automatic numbering of sections with `:sectnum:` is not
  preserved in DocBook, therefore it's not rendered into EPUB, only
  into PDF. Beside, `:sectnum:` makes asciidoctor-pdf add "Chapter X"
  before the text of level-1 headings. Automatic numbering is
  deactivated.
- Decide about titles in English and Interlingue: homogenize or
  markup.
- Add note about accent of "deci" in compounds, from the German
  version.
- Make width of tables depend on the target.
