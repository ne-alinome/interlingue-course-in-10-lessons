- "-ería" is missing (also in the german original). It's only
  mentioned in "-eríe". Meanwhile "barbería" links there.
- "-issim" is missing (also in the german original).
- Check if more suffixes are missing, beside "-ería" and "-issim".
- Improve the description of the effect of exception endings.
- Replace the removed note _"`eu`" as "`éh-oo`"_ with a general
  description of similar cases, from Haas' grammar.
- Improve the style of quotes with CSS.  
- The third column of the table in chapter "Which form to use?"
  doesn't fit well in EPUB on small screens, but it's difficult to
  improve its layout.
