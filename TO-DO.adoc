- Confirm year of the wiki version.
- Rearrange tables in less columns.
- Add changes done to the wiki version.
- Add quotes to example terms in English explanations.
- Fix: automatic numbering of sections with `:sectnum:` is not
  preserved in DocBook, therefore it's not rendered into EPUB, only
  into PDF. Beside, `:sectnum:` makes asciidoctor-pdf add "Chapter X"
  before the text of level-1 headings. Automatic numbering is
  deactivated.
- Add note about the change of the language name.
