- Confirm year of the wiki version.
- Note: automatic numbering of sections with `:sectnum:` is not
  preserved in DocBook, therefore it's not rendered into EPUB, only
  into PDF. Beside, `:sectnum:` makes asciidoctor-pdf add "Chapter X"
  before the text of level-1 headings. That's why automatic numbering
  was deactivated.
- Consult "brilliant", "carriera", "detalli-", "satellite",
  "svimm-"...
- "-ería" is missing (also in the german original). It's only
  mentioned in "-eríe".
- Fix: tre unordered lists in the example blocks of "-age" are
  rendered as ordered lists in EPUB (epub2db). They are ok in PDF. Try
  `*` markups.
