- Confirm year of the wiki version.
- Note: automatic numbering of sections with `:sectnum:` is not
  preserved in DocBook, therefore it's not rendered into EPUB, only
  into PDF. Beside, `:sectnum:` makes asciidoctor-pdf add "Chapter X"
  before the text of level-1 headings. That's why automatic numbering
  was deactivated.
- "-ería" is missing (also in the german original). It's only
  mentioned in "-eríe". Meanwhile "barbería" links there.
- Note: The unordered lists in the example blocks of "-age" are
  rendered as ordered lists in EPUB (epub2db) by one reader, but they
  are rendered ok by other readers. They are ok also in PDF.
- "-issim" is missing (also in the german original).
- Add a note about the PDF size.
- Check what suffixes are missing.
- Use uppercase to mark the stress in the "Stress" subsection.
- Improve the description of the effect of exception endings.
- Add example of plural with "-s" to the "Stress" subsection.
- Add URL
